Stefan: Problem: We have not defined fine-grained subtasks: ToDo for sched-group: Devide "Implementing the scheduler Class"-Task in redmine
Tamil: 
S.B.: set up user-accounts for Deneb-Server
	- prostponed automatic booting
	- updated kernel to 3.xx.60
	- future:
		- little stuff to do on server
		- familiarize with kernel-update progress (=> deploy kernel's we program)
		- get to know how to handle Modules (kill modules used by somehone else)
		- Andrij and Stefan will post to Redmine when there is a solution for this
		- 
	Stephan: "Team-Decision": Stefan B will monitor Kernel-Updates (as he does anyway) 
		and will update Kernel if there are useful changes for us
Lukas: task with two baseline measurements was finished (see redmine)
	Problem with cpuid-command (getting 3 CPU-Registers into c-Variable)
Stephan: On monday evening/latest tuesday morning every teammember shall update his team

Procedure in case of a problem:
	- When the situation appears that one does not know how to continue with a problem, the one must post his problem to redmine (feature-list)
	if it is not fixed until a certain date/deadline, we will have to find another solution (e.g. ask other people not related to the project)

General explanation in mode of working
======================================

First the Product Owner defines product backlog (one for every sprint).
Then every point from the backlog is copied to the sprint (as features)

dont think in problems, think in solutions


find team-person (aside to Stephan) 
"junior scrum master" person to make shure that the project progresses


Problem-discussion: Why was the sprint not finished on thursday?
	Question to think for everyone
