1. Information gathering Sumup
	a - Scheduler Subsystem
	Armand is investigation how to attach qemu pids to a certain scheduler
	also the assigned cpu core is to be configured (cgroups do that),
	controllable via systemcalls
	
	three different scheduler classes in kernel, containing different policies
	Mohammad suggests a short presentation about these, we think everyone can read that up
	
	Still research to be done, generic overview is present
	missing till now:
		required hook to a scheduler class (prerequirities by the kernel)
		interfaces of data structures of pids in the kernel
	
	b - VMs (How to assign a KVM pid (qemu) to a scheduler)
	Stephan F. says it's easy and solved
	(as long as we implement a corresponding scheduler)
	
	c - CPU power Interface
	frequency control is easily done via cpufreq under /sys/devices/...
	what about p- and c-state control?
	what about timers in p-states and idle?
	status of peripherals in different power states?

length of sprints:
	3 weeks.
	
meeting tomorrow: 14-16. Decision for next week then.
